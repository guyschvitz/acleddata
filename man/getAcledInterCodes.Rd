\title{Get ACLED API Interaction Codes}
\usage{
getAcledInterCodes()
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of API interaction codes where names are interaction
  descriptions and values are the corresponding numeric codes.
}
\description{
Retrieve all available ACLED interaction codes that can be used to filter API queries
by actor interactions. These codes represent different types of interactions between
actors in conflict events, including single-actor events and dyadic interactions.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get all available interaction codes
interactions <- getAcledInterCodes()
print(interactions)

# Use specific interaction codes in API query
data <- getAcledData(
  access.token = "your_token_here",
  interaction = interactions["State forces-Civilians"],
  country = "Syria"
)

# Filter for state forces only events
state.events <- getAcledData(
  access.token = "your_token_here",
  interaction = interactions["State forces only"],
  year = "2023"
)
}
